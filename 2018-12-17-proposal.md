Dr. Thiem,

I am considering applying for summer programs outside the MATH dept. They are:

Summer program | Reference deadline | Topic area
--- | --- | ---
NSF MSCI | 2019-01-29 | renewable and sustainable energy 
UCAR SIParCS |  2018-01-18 | historical weather data
UCAR SIParCS |  2018-01-18 | climate modelling

I am wondering if it would be appropriate to ask for your reference.

Pros:

- Even a vague expression of praise for graduate-level work would be good, since my undergraduate references simply can't address it.
- This semester in algebra, I've progressed from having "gaps in my background" to working with intermediate proficiency.
- Since September, I've coordinated a weekly review group with other students in the course.

Cons: 

- I merely have taken graduate algebra with you---a generic letter might hurt my chances.
- We've never worked together on anything.
- Timeliness.
